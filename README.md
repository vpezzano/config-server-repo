# config-server-repo
This project is in relation to spring-config-server and spring-config-client. The target is to enable the microservice
spring-config-client to read properties provided by the microservice spring-config-server. In this project, we just
include the properties we want to read. When testing locally (see Git repo location in bootstrap.properties file in
project spring-config-server), the project folder has to be copied to the desktop.
